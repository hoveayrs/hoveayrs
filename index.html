					Thys Clothing Project is my attempt to create items of clothing that make me feel naturally confident and comfortable. </br>
					They’re designs that combine my love of colour with significant feelings and memories from my life. </br>
					Each design represents a feeling that I experience. By wearing that symbol it allows me to understand and express that feeling in a different way. </br>
					It was important for me to design because i believe feeling comfortable is as much about feeling comfortable in your own skin as it wearing a comfortable clothing.
